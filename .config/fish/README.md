It is somewhat self explanitory in here.

config.fish 
    alises, other things can go here, but there isn't much of a need.

fish_variables
    not quite sure.
    looks like a list of variables.

functions/
    prompt_pwd.fish                     prints the working directory
    fish_prompy.fish                    is the main prompt settings file
    fish_git_prompt.fish                adds git branch
    fish_default_mode_prompt.fish       settings for prompts vim mode

install neovim
install plug, and run pluginstall
install gruvbox theme for terminal emulator

put above files in ~/.config/fish/


And that should give you the best damn terminal experience ever
